1. What is a regular expression and how does it work?

> A regular expression or RegEx contains a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
Regex is used to check a string and see if it contains a specified search pattern.  Python has a built-in package
that works with regular expression that is called "re".  The package is used by importing the re module: import re.
Within the module that are RegEx functions such as "findall" and "search".  These are used in conjunction with metacharacters,
special sequences and sets to perform searches.


2. What is an array and how does it work?

> An array is a data structure that contains a group of elements that are usually of the same data type (integer, string, etc.). In Python, this is the main difference between arrays and lists.  While python lists can contain values corresponding to different data types, arrays in python can only contain values corresponding to same data type.  To use arrays in python language, you need to import the standard ‘array’ module. This is because array is not a fundamental data type like strings, integer etc. An array works by storing values at index positions that can be reliably computed at any point in time.

3. What is a hash table and how does it work?

> A hash table is simply an array with its elements indexed by a hashed key. That makes accessing the data faster as the index value behaves as a key for the data value. In other words Hash table stores key-value pairs but the key is generated through a hashing function.  It works by taking a key (a first and last name, for example), computing its hash using a hash function, then using that hashed value as the index for the array.
